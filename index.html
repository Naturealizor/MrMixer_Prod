			<h2>Looking for A way to add a little personal touch?</h2>

				We’ll be going through some different decals to try and find ones that everyone can get behind, so keep
				an eye out if you’re looking for something a bit different. Or if you’d like to suggest something feel

			<h2>Why repairing and servicing your mixer is better than buying new!</h2>
			<p>Re-greasing is the service we started this business with. So many of our customers had nowhere to go with
				a failing or even broken mixer. A lot of the time, all they need is to be opened up and given a little
				lovin’ and
				they’ll be working as good as new. With as many moving parts on the inside, making sure everything is
				well lubricated and
				still in good shape is essential to making sure these wonderful machines last for years and years.</p>

			<p>If it’s been a while since your machine has been serviced, or if it never has been, there’s a good
				chance the oil inside has started to separate and harden. If this gets bad enough, the gears will start
				to grind and even
				start to chip and break apart sending little shards of metal flying everywhere. This could easily put a
				mixer out of
				commission, which is why re-greasing is so important. For how much these machines cost, having them
				properly maintained every
				couple of years will greatly increase their life, and keep you from having to shell out another $300+ on
				a new one!!</p>

			<h2>We offer a wide variety of parts for the most common issues, and we're always expanding out shop selection as we expand!</h2>
			<p>Look no further if you’re needing to find a certain part for your mixer. We carry most parts that you’ll
				need for your
				KitchenAid mixer, and resupply as often as we can depending on the current market availability. If
				there’s something
				you’re looking for that you don’t see in our store, shoot us an email and we’ll see what we can find for
				you!</p>

			<p>We’re also planning on expanding our store to include some decorations to add a personal touch to your
				mixer, and
				getting some kits put together that will help the DIYers out there. We're also planning on getting
				attachments in stock
				as well as some videos on what all you can do with them. As orders increase, so will our ability to
				carry extra parts,
				attachments and other mixing essentials!</p>

		<article class="content-wrapper-black">“These 3 videos were excellent and very helpful in my DIY to disassemble, de-grease, re-grease and reassemble my wife's KitchenAid. I looked at two other videos and Mr. Mixer's was the best by far.”
			– Youtube comment (Wayne Anthony)
			“Hey Mr Mixer! I used to use one of these machines when I worked in the industry 30 yeas ago. I found one at an estate sale for $20 bucks and am about to Re-Grease it. I’m thoroughly enjoying your lesson/tutorial. You’re such a good natured person and I’m looking forward to finding you on TikTok! In the mean time I’ll continue watching part three and report back when I’m finished.”
			– youtube comment (richie8a8y)
